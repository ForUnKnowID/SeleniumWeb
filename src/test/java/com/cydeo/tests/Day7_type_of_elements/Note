Class Notes-7

Assertions

Assert --> this is the class in testNg, it has methods used to do assertions like when we compare values.

in testng, if assertion fails, rest of the method will NOT execute, it will be ignored/skipped.

If your code fail in one @Test annotation, it will not effect other @Test s, each of them working independently.

Note: whether your testcase fail or not, your before and after method will executed ALWAYS. so even if you code failes, you can quit from driver, close browser.

4 types of assertion

Assert.assertEquals(actual,expected)--> it checks two value same or not

Assert.assertTrue(condition) --> it checks whether condition return true or not

Assert.assertFalse(condition) --> it verifies condition return false or not

Assert.assertNotEquals(actual,expected) --> verifies that two vvalues are NOT equal to each other


we can add message to all of our assertions to see what we are checking

Assert.assertTrue(condition,message);
Assert.assertEquals(actual,expected,message);
=========================================
Radio Buttons

Radio button is a type of elements in which only one option can be selected among group of options (Example: Gender - Male,Female,Other)

Based on the requirements you might or might not have default option selected.

//how to check radio button selected or not ?
isSelected() --> if radio buttons selected it will return true, if not it will return false.

//how to select radio button ?
we can use click() method for selecting radio buttons

//how can we check if the webelement is enabled ?
isEnabled()--> method that reutrns true if the button enabled, if not it returns false.


When we try to interact with disabled elements 2 things can happen:
1.no action will be happen and code will not fail, not complain
2.no action will be happen but we can get ElementNotInteractableException: element not interactable
========================================
Checkboxes

Checkboxes are type of input elements which can be selected or unselected.
When we have group of checkboxes selecting or unselecting one checkbox does NOT affect on the selection of the other one.

Just like a radio buttons we use isSelected() method to check checkboxes are selected or not.
to select or unselect the checkboxes we use click() method.

========================================

getAttribute("attributeName")
//when we pass valid attribute naem to getAttribute method, it will return the value of that attribute.

//if you pass non existing attribute it will return null to you.

//"outerHTML" returns full html of that element

Example:
<button class="btn btn-primary" onclick="button2()" name="button2">Button 2</button>

When we need to get text of the web element
1.getText();
2.getAttribute("value"); (inputboxes)
3.getAttribute("innerHTML"); --> it will work certain cases
4.getAttribute("outerHTML"); --> manipulate and verify(contains)
